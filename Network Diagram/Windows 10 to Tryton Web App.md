These rules ensure that the workstation can only reach the Tryton Web App through HTTPS.  
All other traffic is blocked and logged for SIEM analysis.
## ✅ **Allow Rules**

`WIN10_PRO  -->  TRYTON_WEB_APP : TCP 443 (Outbound)`
`TRYTON_WEB_APP  -->  WIN10_PRO : ESTABLISHED/RELATED`
`WIN10_PRO  -->  DNS_SERVERS : UDP/TCP 53 
`WIN10_PRO  -->  NTP_SERVER : UDP 123 `


## ❌ **Deny Rules**

`ANY_REMOTE  -->  WIN10_PRO : ANY (Inbound)`

**Purpose:**  
Prevents unauthorized inbound connections to the workstation unless part of an established session.

`WIN10_PRO  -->  VLAN20 : ANY (Outbound except HTTPS 443)`

**Purpose:**  
Prevents users from accessing internal servers directly.

## ⚙️ **Configurations**

> [!danger] **Workstation cannot directly access Tryton on port 8000**  
> Port 8000 is _never_ exposed to clients — access is only through HTTPS 443 → NAT → 8000.

---

> [!note] **Windows Firewall must be set to "Block inbound connections" (default)**  
> Ensures only established sessions from HTTPS responses are allowed back in.

---

> [!info] **Outbound filtering enabled for sensitive zones**  
> Only web (443), DNS (53), NTP (123), Kerberos (88/389/445), and Wazuh agent ports should be allowed.

---

> [!tip] **Log dropped outbound traffic for SIEM ingestion**  
> Helps detect compromised workstations attempting lateral movement.

## 📌 **Summary (Team Notes)**

- Users reach Tryton only through **HTTPS 443**, not port 8000.
    
- Windows Firewall only needs outbound allow rules for:
    
    - **443** (to Tryton NAT address)
        
    - **DNS / NTP**
        
    - **Kerberos / LDAP / SMB**
        
    - **Wazuh agent ports (1514/1515)** if required
        
- Everything else remains blocked by default.
